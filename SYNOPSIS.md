## Motivation

Python has a large adoption amongst data scientist, and offers a toolbox ready to use for crunching numbers.
Over time it has become easyer to source skilled labour, regarding the development of computational software.
In this solution the the surface is barely scratched, but if it was to be extended with additional functionality, it would be a rather trivial task to just hook into code, written by people who are better at math than myself.

Dotnet is available on most platforms these days, and offers a toolset that makes it easy to develop a lot of functionality, within a limited time frame. It is also rather performand (especially compared to python), and for trivial tasks like this, it is easy to find skilled enough engineers
